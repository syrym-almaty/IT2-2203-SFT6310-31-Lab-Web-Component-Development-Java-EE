# IT2-2203-Web-Component-Development-Java-EE

## Overview

Welcome to the repository for the Web Component Development Lab. In this project, each student will work on their own branch to contribute and learn the process of version control and collaboration using Git and GitHub. The main branch is protected and can only be updated by the instructor.



### Guidelines for Collaborators

- **Main branch protection**: Only the instructor can make changes to the `main` branch.
- **Student branches**: Each student must create and work on their own branch, named after their GitHub username (e.g., `student-username`).
- **Feature development**: All changes should be made in your individual branch. Once completed, changes can be pushed and reviewed.
