> ## GitHub SSH Configuration Guide

---

> ## This document outlines the steps to set up SSH for GitHub and automate your workflow using the command line.

---

## SSH Configuration for GitHub

---

## 1. Check Git Configuration

> Ensure your Git configuration is set up correctly:

```bash

git config --global --list

```

## 2. Set Up Your User Information

> Configure your username and email (replace with demo credentials if needed):

```bash

git config --global user.name "yourusername"
git config --global user.email "youremail@example.com"

```

## 3. Generate SSH Key

> Generate an SSH key for authentication:

```bash

ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "youremail@example.com"

```

Use a secure passphrase when prompted.

## 4. Start the SSH Agent

> Run the SSH agent in the background:

```bash

eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"

```

## 5. Add Your SSH Key

> Add your SSH private key to the SSH agent:

```bash

ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_ed25519

```

## 6. Verify the SSH Key

> List the keys added to the SSH agent:

```bash

ssh-add -l

```

## 7. Copy Your Public Key

> Copy your SSH public key to add it to GitHub:

```bash

cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub

```

Then visit GitHub SSH Keys to add it.

> Alternatively, you can copy it directly to the clipboard:

```bash

clip < ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub

```

## 8. test SSH Connection

> test your SSH connection to GitHub:

```bash

ssh -T git@github.com

```

You should see a message indicating successful authentication.

## 9. Set Remote Repository URL

> If you encounter issues pushing data, set the remote URL:

```bash

git remote set-url origin git@github.com:yourusername/your-repository.git

```

## 10. Push and Pull Changes

> Push your changes to the remote repository:

```bash

git push --set-upstream origin master

```

> You can also push changes to specific branches:

```bash

git push origin test

```

> To pull updates from the remote repository:

```bash

git pull origin test

```

> If necessary, force push to a branch:

```bash

git push --force origin test

```

Creating a Repository from the Terminal
> To create a new GitHub repository directly from your terminal, follow these steps:

> Navigate to your project directory:

```bash

cd /path/to/your/project

```

> Initialize a new Git repository:

```bash

git init

```

> Stage and commit your files:

```bash

git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit"

```

> Add the remote repository:

```bash

git remote add origin git@github.com:yourusername/your-repository.git

```

> Push to the remote repository:

```bash

git push -u origin master

```

The -u flag sets the upstream tracking for future pushes and pulls.

Using GitHub CLI on Ubuntu 20
> To manage GitHub repositories easily, install the GitHub CLI:

```bash

sudo apt install gh

```

Log in to your GitHub account:

```bash

gh auth login

```

List your repositories:

```bash

gh repo list

```

Automate Your Bash Configuration
> You can automate your .bashrc file to streamline your workflow. Open the file for editing:

```bash

nano ~/.bashrc

```

Add Configuration
> Add the following lines to your .bashrc file:

```bash

# Add your scripts directory to the PATH
export PATH=$PATH:/c/Users/yourName/scripts

# Alias for creating GitHub repositories easily
alias create-repo='python /c/Users/yourName/scripts/create_repo.py'

# Aliases for listing repositories
alias listreposhttps='curl -H "Authorization: token YOUR_PAT" https://api.github.com/user/repos?per_page=100 | jq -r ".[].clone_url"'
alias listreposssh='curl -H "Authorization: token YOUR_PAT" https://api.github.com/user/repos?per_page=100 | jq -r ".[].ssh_url"'

# Automatically source the .bashrc file on each new session
alias reloadbash='source ~/.bashrc'
alias editbash='nano ~/.bashrc && source ~/.bashrc'

```

Reload Your Configuration
> After saving changes, reload your .bashrc file:

```bash

source ~/.bashrc

```

# IT2-2203-SFT6310-31-Lab-Web-Component-Development-Java-EE

## Overview

Welcome to the repository for the Web Component Development Lab. In this project, each student will work on their own branch to contribute and learn the process of version control and collaboration using Git and GitHub. The main branch is protected and can only be updated by the instructor.



### Guidelines for Collaborators

- **Main branch protection**: Only the instructor can make changes to the `main` branch.
- **Student branches**: Each student must create and work on their own branch, named after their GitHub username (e.g., `student-username`).
- **Feature development**: All changes should be made in your individual branch. Once completed, changes can be pushed and reviewed.

## Download Git for windows

## Instructions for Students

### 1. Cloning the Repository

First, clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:

```bash

// over https
git clone https://github.com/syrym-almaty/IT2-2203-SFT6310-31-Lab-Web-Component-Development-Java-EE.git

// over ssh
git clone git@github.com/syrym-almaty/IT2-2203-SFT6310-31-Lab-Web-Component-Development-Java-EE.git

cd IT2-2204-SFT6310-32-Lab-Web-Component-Development-Java-EE-Lab

# Open the H2 console at

# Credentials

Driver Class: org.h2.Driver
JDBC URL: jdbc:h2:file:./data/demo-db
User Name: sa
Password: password

# run sql commands in http://localhost:8080/h2-console

SHOW TABLES;
SELECT * FROM STUDENT;



# Switch to an existing branch:


git checkout <branch_name>

git switch <branch_name>

git checkout main


# Create and switch to a new branch:


git checkout -b <new_branch_name>

git switch -c <new_branch_name>

git checkout -b feature/new-feature


# AFTER GIT PULL COMMAND merge conflicts how to solve them
<<<<<<< HEAD
// Your local changes
=======
 // Changes from the main branch
>>>>>>> main


# Rebasing Instead of Merging

## Step 1: Ensure you're on your local branch (e.g., feature/new-feature):

git checkout feature/new-feature

## Step 2: Fetch the latest changes from the main branch:

git fetch origin

## Step 3: Rebase your branch onto the latest main:

git rebase origin/main

## Step 4: If there are conflicts, Git will pause and let you resolve them manually. After resolving them, use:

git add <conflicted_file>
git rebase --continue

## Step 5: Once the rebase is done, push your changes:

git push --force-with-lease

# Resolve Conflicts Without Manual Deletion

## Use a Merge Tool

### Launch a merge tool:

git mergetool

## Automatic Conflict Resolution with ours or theirs

### Use ours strategy (to keep your local changes):

git merge -X ours main

### Use theirs strategy (to keep the changes from main):

git merge -X theirs main

# Best Practices to Avoid Future Merge Conflicts

## Pull Frequently from Main

git checkout main
git pull origin main
git checkout feature/new-feature
git merge main

# Make Smaller, Isolated Changes

## Keeping your changes small and isolated to specific parts of the codebase helps reduce conflicts, as the more you modify the same areas, the higher the chance of conflicts.

# Communicate with the Team

## If you and your team are working on the same files, communication is key. Avoid editing the same files simultaneously unless necessary.

# Using git rerere (Reuse Recorded Resolutions)

## Enable rerere:

git config --global rerere.enabled true

# When Merging Cannot Be Avoided

## Git will mark the conflicting files with the conflict markers (<<<<<<, ======, >>>>>>).

## You will need to resolve conflicts manually by choosing the correct version of the code.

## After resolving the conflicts, you must:
git add <conflicted_file>
git commit

# Key Commands:

# Rebasing Workflow (Preferred):

# Ensure you are on the feature branch
git checkout feature/new-feature

# Fetch the latest changes from the remote repository
git fetch origin

# Rebase your branch on top of main
git rebase origin/main

# Resolve any conflicts, then:
git add <conflicted_file>
git rebase --continue

# Push the changes (with force to avoid conflicts)
git push --force-with-lease


# Merging Workflow (If Needed):
# Ensure you are on the feature branch
git checkout feature/new-feature

# Pull changes from main and merge
git pull origin main

# Resolve any conflicts manually
git add <conflicted_file>
git commit

# Push the changes
git push origin feature/new-feature
